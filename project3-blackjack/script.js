// player vs. computer
// first deck must be shuffled
// player will deal 2 cards (using the for loop)
// player will decide whether to hit (draw another card) or stand (end the turn)
// compute total score for player and computer
// decide on the winner, with condition that the score does not exceed 21. If one scores above 21, immediately loses, using the if condition
